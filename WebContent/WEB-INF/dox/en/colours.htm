  Mango provides multiple places where colours can be defined. In general where colours are defined as text strings the
  same rules apply. Any value acceptable as a CSS color can be entered. Only the colour <em>value</em> should be 
  provided. For example, valid values for red include (excluding the quotes) "#FF0000", "red", "#F00", "rgb(255, 0, 0), 
  and "rgb(100%, 0%, 0%)" A simple description of valid colour values can be found

  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/" target="_blank">W3C</a>
